        <h2>Career</h2>
        <p>I have a decades worth of experience working for companies that build digital products, starting in a project coordinator role for a large retailer just beginning their e-commerce journey back in 2009. Over that time I picked up new and interesting ways of working from colleagues, clients and training I sought out myself. I love to try new things, and to encourage others around me to keep experimenting also with the way that they do things.</p>
        <p>My background as a Project Manager has put me in a good position to juggle my time, and it allows me to prioritise learning whilst still being focussed on my day job.</p>

        <h2>Who have I worked with?</h2>
        <p>I've been lucky enough to work on projects for the following companies:</p>
        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>Github</li>
          <li>React</li>
        </ul>
        <p>In the future I'd love to work more with non-profit organisations as well as those that are at the cutting edge of our industry.</p>
        <p>I have strong personal ties to JDRF - the Juvenile Diabetes Research Fund, who you can find out more about here.</p>
