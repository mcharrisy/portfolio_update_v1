        <h2>JDRF</h2>
        <p>JDRF is a diabetes charity that funds research to cure, treat and prevent type 1. They work with government, academia and industry to accelerate research and within healthcare policy to ensure that the outcomes of research are delivered to people with type 1 across the world. And importantly they give support and a voice to people with type 1 and their families. One day they aim to create a world without type 1 diabetes.</p>
        <p>As someone who lives with type 1 diabetes, I like to inform people about the existance of JDRF and all the good work they do. There's no reason why a cure for type 1 can't be found in our lifetime, and it would change the lives of millions for the better.</p>

        <h2>What is Type 1 diabetes?</h2>
        <p>Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition. For reasons we don’t yet fully understand, your immune system – which is meant to protect you from viruses and bacteria – attacks and destroys the insulin-producing cells in your pancreas, called beta cells.

        <p>Insulin is crucial to life. When you eat, insulin moves the energy from your food, called glucose, from your blood into the cells of your body. When the beta cells in your pancreas fail to produce insulin, glucose levels in your blood start to rise and your body can’t function properly. Over time this high level of glucose in the blood may damage nerves and blood vessels and the organs they supply.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Approximately <b>400,000</b> people are currently living with type 1 diabetes in the UK, with over <b>29,000</b> of them children</li>
          <li>Although it used to be referred to as <b>‘juvenile diabetes’</b>, around half of newly diagnosed cases are in people over the age of 18</li>
          <li>A person with type 1 diabetes will have around <b>65,000 injections</b> and measure their blood glucose over <b>80,000 times</b> in their lifetime</li>
          <li>Incidence is increasing by about <b>four per cent</b> each year, particularly in children under five, with a five percent increase each year in this age group over the last 20 years</li>
